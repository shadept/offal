## Logline

A browser-based turn-based roguelike set in a ship graveyard in deep space. Your body is modular — you graft limbs from enemies, craft with whatever's at hand, and everything interacts with simple physics. The result is systematically logical and frequently absurd.

---

## Setting

**Shipwreck Nebula** — a graveyard of vessels in deep space, each procedurally generated. Technology is steam-punk meets biomechanics: creatures that evolved in isolation for decades, things with radial symmetry floating in zero-gravity corridors, metallic quadrupeds that rusted until they became alive, bipeds so heavily grafted they're barely recognizable.

You are a **Salvager**. Your job was simple — enter, recover cargo, exit. It did not go well.

The comedy is not forced. It emerges from a universe where everything is biomechanical and nothing works as intended.

---

## Architecture: Data-Driven by Default

All game content lives in **JSON5 data files**. The engine knows about systems; it does not know about content. No material, item, creature, or recipe is hardcoded.

Adding content = writing a data file. No code change required.

The crafting system reasons over **properties and tags**, not item IDs.

---

## Core Principles

These apply to every design decision:

1. **Every advantage has risk.** Grafting, amputation, body transformation — all carry genuine danger. Preparation is rewarded. Impulse is punished.

2. **The system is the designer.** Interactions emerge from rules, not from scripted outcomes. Comedy and drama are side effects of consistency.

3. **Locomotion follows structure.** Locomotion type is derived from active slots — not declared. Lose your legs, graft serpent segments, and your body becomes something else.

4. **Adaptation takes time.** A new body plan performs poorly until the nervous system catches up. Affinity grows through use, not through menus.

## Data Schemas

The full schema reference lives in `docs/SCHEMAS.md`. This section describes the intent of each schema.

**Material** — physical properties of any substance: flammability, conductivity, hardness, mass, reactions. Referenced by limbs, items, tiles, and environmental features.

**Item** — a thing in the world: material, shape, size, tags. Interactions are not defined in the item — they emerge from its properties meeting the physics and crafting systems.

**Recipe** — what can be made from what. Inputs match by tags/properties, not by ID. Multiple recipes can match the same inputs — the player chooses intent. Unrecognised combinations fall through to a fallback that always produces something.

**Blueprint** — a structural body archetype: slot layout and default occupants. Does not declare locomotion. Blueprints are inherited by species.

**Species** — extends a blueprint with biological specifics: materials, size range, slot overrides, additional slots. The player's starting options are species.

**FunctionRule** — maps `limbType × slotRole` to capabilities. A tentacle in an arm slot attacks; in a leg slot it grips; in a back slot it flanks. Same limb, different function, different position.

**PhysicsRule** — defines how physical states propagate. Fire spreads to flammables, water extinguishes fire, electricity propagates through conductors. The physics system runs these rules; it does not know "fire" specifically.

## Systems

### Body System

Entities have modular bodies. Each slot holds a limb with its own HP and material. Losing a limb opens a stump. Stumps can be grafted.

**Limb loss** — whether from combat or voluntary amputation — causes bleeding. Bleeding stacks and kills if untreated. There is no safe operation.

**Grafting** costs turns. An actively bleeding wound cannot receive a graft until treated. Organic limbs seal wounds; non-organic limbs do not. Mismatched materials may reject.

**Locomotion** is derived from active slots at all times. Radical body changes produce locomotion affinity penalties that fade with use — the penalty is worst when the player is most vulnerable, and disappears as they commit to the new form.

### Physics System

Physical states (fire, wet, charged, pressurised) propagate according to data-defined rules. Limb materials participate in this system — a wooden arm burns, a metal arm conducts, a crystal arm shatters into shards.

### Crafting System

Two tiers:
- **Known recipes**: matched by input properties. Ambiguous combinations offer a choice.
- **Fallback**: unrecognised combinations always produce something — a crude composite. In Phase 6+, a local LLM names and describes the result; a sprite is synthesised procedurally. Graceful degradation if unavailable.

### Alchemy System

Potions have unknown effects per run (shuffled at start). Discovered by drinking, dipping items, or combining. Effects defined in data.

### Adaptive Ecology System

The game tracks how the player fights. Enemies in unexplored rooms are biased toward countering the dominant pattern. Fire spammer → fire-resistant variants appear. Head-targeter → headless variants appear. Gradual, not sudden. Defined in data rules.

---

## Procedural Generation

Ships are generated per run from hull type templates. Each ship has multiple decks; each deck ends in a boss. Room contents are weighted by depth.

---

## Meta Progression

Persistent unlocks (new blueprints, materials, hull types) earned by in-run conditions. Codex of discovered entries. Run history. No XP.

---

## Technical

**Stack**: TypeScript + Phaser 3 + bitECS + Vite  
**Data format**: JSON5  
**Assets**: Kenney.nl CC0 as base  
**Sprites**: modular per limb, composed at runtime for hybrid bodies
